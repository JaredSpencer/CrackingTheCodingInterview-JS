These are my solutions to problems from the book Cracking the Coding Interview (5th edition) in Javascript. I am also adding my implementations of common data structures.

The problems in the book are created for Java and C++ so not all are well suited for Javascript. 

I am doing this mainly to expand my own knowledge. If there are any issues, please feel free to add a Github issue. Additionally, I welcome contributions to this project. If you have your own solution in Javascript, please make a pull request.
